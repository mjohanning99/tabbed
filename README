My version of tabbed 
=================================
This is my version of tabbed which has been modified to include support for the Vimb browser and which has a few modified keybindings.
Below you will find the original README of this program.

tabbed is a simple tabbed X window container.

the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install tabbed
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install
